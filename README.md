## About the project  

To be filled in later  


## Repository Organization  

Sub-folders of this repository were created to provide some organization of the different coding needs for the project. Current sub-folders are:  

-  `Data` - meant to contain data, although the full dataset is not committed due to its size.  
-  `Data_processing` - scripts that start with downloaded data, combine all years for each station, then combine all stations from each type (WQ/NUT).  
-  `helper_files` - scripts of functions and definitions (e.g. which parameters and flags/codes to use) that are needed across sub-folders.  
-  `MDLs` - explorations of nutrient data that may be below detection.  
-  `QAQC_flags` - explorations of data by QA/QC flag status, based on definitions of which flags and codes will lead to data being kept or discarded for this project.  
-  `model_packages` - explorations of different R packages that can be used to calculate trends on SWMP data - how each of them works, and how results compare between them.  
-  `other` - assorted scripts for individuals' exploration that don't fall under other needed categories.
