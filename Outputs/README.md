# Outputs Folder  

The structure of this folder mirrors that of `R/Analyses_for_paper`. Sub-folders exist for each of the different steps beyond the processed data.  


## 01_calculated_medians  

Based on the monthly processed data files, overall medians were calculated for WQ, NUT, and MET parameters. For NUT parameters, regression on order statistics (ROS) was used to account for censored data. At HUD stations, NO3 was used as a proxy for NO23.  



## 01b_median-clustering-DP-CF  

These files were generated by Dave Parrish and Carl Friedrichs at VIMS/CBV NERR based on their PCAs and clustering of overall, long-term water quality medians. They had been working on this clustering before this large synthesis project, and all involved decided the synergy made it worth including in this work. In May 2024, they generated updated outputs based on the medians calculated in this project (different qa/qc choices had been made and censored data were dealt with differently).   


## 02_calculated_long-term-trends  


`long-term-trends.RData` contains all calculated WQ, MET, and NUT trends, as separate data frames. `trends_df` contains WQ trends, `trends_met` contains MET trends, and `trends_nut` contains NUT trends. generated by `R/Analyses_for_paper/02_long-term-trend_analyses.Rmd`.  

`long-term-trends.csv` contains all calculated WQ, MET, and NUT trends, bound together in one table. generated by `R/Analyses_for_paper/02_long-term-trend_analyses.Rmd`.  

Both files have the same fields (columns), laid out in `data_dictionary_trend_analyses.csv`.  

Parameters on which trends were calculated are described in `data_dictionary_trend_parameters.csv`, with additional detail in the `R/Data_processing` folder README.  

### bam_outputs folder  

Individual station/parameter outputs from running the GAMs were saved as individual `.RData` files in case they need further examination (e.g. appraising the residuals and/or predicting other values). The naming convention for these files is `stationname_parameter_bam.RData`.  



## 03_calculated_seasonality  

`seasonal_amplitude_medians.rds/.csv` This is a data frame containing median seasonal amplitude of temp, chla, and DO by station, as calculated in `R/Analyses_for_paper/03_seasonalAmplitude_and_itsTrends.Rmd`  


`seasonal_amplitude_trends.rds/csv` data frame containing the estimates for trend (per year), se, and p-values for chl, DO mg/L, and temperature normalized seasonal amplitudes. As of 2/23/2024 autocorrelation has not been accounted for, so p-values are probably too low. generated by `R/Analyses_for_paper/03_seasonalAmplitude_and_itsTrends.Rmd`  

## 04_compiled_predictors  

This folder contains two csv files to potentially use in predictive modeling. The main file is `compiled_predictors.csv`; it contains one row per station, and one column for each parameter's median and trend at that station, as well as latitude. When DO<2 trend could not be calculated for 5 stations, the datasets were inspected, and DO<2 was always 0. As such, 0 was inserted for doLT2_trend for these stations.  

`compiled_predictors_withExternalInfo.csv` is almost the same file, but with many parameters from SWMP CLUE ([overview](https://www.nerra.org/swmp-clue/); [parameters](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yfg62Fpfs8jZ2UnuCv2VA7wSfaAxVj0o/edit?gid=198754012#gid=198754012)) added as columns. **0s may not have been inserted for DO<2 trend, so double-check this if you want to use that column from this file.**   


## 05_predictive_modeling  

This folder does not contain outputs because predictive modeling and evaluation was performed interactively. It remains here for consistency with `R/Analyses_for_paper`.  


## 06_model_selection  

### R_objects folder  

This folder contains `.RData` objects for each response with output from model dredging (`out` in the file name) and model averaging (`post-averaging` in the file name). I'm using `chl` in describing objects here, but for `domgl` and `doLT2` objects, replace `chl` with the appropriate response.   

`out` objects contain the following:  

-  `chla_subsets` - a data.frame that is also a model.selection object, containing information on each of the models generated from the use of `MuMIn::dredge()` on the global model.  
-  `dat_chl` - the data frame used to generate the global model. All variables have been centered and scaled to 1 standard deviation.    
-  `mod_chl` - the global model object from which subsets were generated.  



`post-averaging` objects contain the following:  

-  `coeffs_stnd` - table of standardized coefficients from averaging a top model set of delta < 4.  
-  `dat_chl` - the data frame used to generate the global model. All variables have been centered and scaled to 1 standard deviation.   
-  `dat_means` - a data frame with a single row containing the mean for each variable. Used with `dat_chl` and `dat_sds` to back-calculate to original units from standardized units.  
-  `dat_sds` - a data frame with a single row containing the standard deviation of each variable. Used with `dat_chl` and `dat_means` to back-calculate to original units.  
-  `mod_avgd2` / `d4` / `d6` - model averaging object containing outputs of `MuMIn::model.avg()` using delta < 2 (or 4, or 6) to subset the models.  
-  `mod_chl` - the global model object.  
-  `top_modsd2` / `d4` / `d6`  - model selection table for the subset of models with delta < 2 (or 4, or 6).  
-  `top_modsd2_unnested` / `d4` / `d6` - model selection table for the subset of models with delta < 2 (or 4, or 6), but with models removed if they were only a more complex version of a model with lower AICc.  


## 07_visualizations  

This folder contains outputs from scripts in `R/Analyses_for_paper/07_visualizations`. At this point the files are exploring medians and long-term trends, but I expect more will be added in the future.
