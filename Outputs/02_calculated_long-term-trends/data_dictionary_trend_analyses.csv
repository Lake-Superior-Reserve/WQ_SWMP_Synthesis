Column Name,Type,Description
station,character,seven- or eight-letter SWMP station code. First three letters represent individual Reserve; next two letters identify the station within the Reserve; last 2-3 letters are data type (wq/nut/met)
parameter,character,which parameter the trends on this row describe. See `data_dictionary_trend_parameters.csv` for more detail.
Slope,numeric,"parameter trend per year, as the overall linear trend from a GAM"
std.error,numeric,standard error of the slope estimate
conf.low,numeric,low end of 95% confidence interval of slope estimate
conf.high,numeric,high end of 95% confidence interval of slope estimate
statistic,numeric,"test statistic used to calculate p-value, for slope estimate"
p.value,numeric,unadjusted p-value for slope estimate
Seas_edf,numeric,estimated degrees of freedom for seasonal term of the GAM
Seas_ref.df,integer,"reference degrees of freedom for seasonal term of the GAM. 10 if all 12 knots could be used; if lower, then k had to be adjusted."
Seas_stat,numeric,"test statistic used to calculate p-value, for seasonal term of GAM"
Seas_p.val,numeric,unadjusted p-value for seasonal term of GAM
R2_adj,numeric,adjusted R^2 for the GAM overall
Dev_expl,numeric,deviance explained by the GAM
model_error,logical,FALSE if model ran okay; TRUE if model produced an error and estimates are not available
ar1_start,numeric,estimated lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient of GAM residuals after initial GAM run (no adjustment for autocorrelation yet)
threshold,numeric,"threshold of 95% confidence interval for the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation of residuals, as calculated in custom bam functions"
model_refit,logical,"TRUE if ar1_start exceeded the threshold and identified significant autocorrelation in the GAM residuals, leading to an adjustment of the AR term in the GAM and the model being re-run to account for the autocorrelation. FALSE if ar1_start did not exceed the threshold and the model did not need to be re-run to account for autocorrelation of the residuals."
ar1_end,numeric,"estimated lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient of GAM residuals after adjusting (if necessary) for autocorrelation. If model_refit was TRUE, this number should be much closer to 0 than ar1_start."
ts_start,numeric,time series start: decimal date of the first valid reading in the time series
ts_end,numeric,time series end: decimal date of last valid reading in the time series
ts_length,numeric,"time series length: length of the time series, in years"
n_points,integer,number of valid points in the time series
overall_median,numeric,median of all valid points in the time series
Fall_estimate,numeric,"slope estimate of simple linear trend in the Fall months, per year"
Winter_estimate,numeric,"slope estimate of simple linear trend in the Winter months, per year"
Spring_estimate,numeric,"slope estimate of simple linear trend in the Spring months, per year"
Summer_estimate,numeric,"slope estimate of simple linear trend in the Summer months, per year"
Fall_std.error,numeric,standard error of the Fall slope estimate
Winter_std.error,numeric,standard error of the Winter slope estimate
Spring_std.error,numeric,standard error of the Spring slope estimate
Summer_std.error,numeric,standard error of the Summer slope estimate
Fall_p.value,numeric,unadjusted p-value for the Fall slope estimate
Winter_p.value,numeric,unadjusted p-value for the Winter slope estimate
Spring_p.value,numeric,unadjusted p-value for the Spring slope estimate
Summer_p.value,numeric,unadjusted p-value for the Summer slope estimate
sig_trend,yes/no,significant trend: yes if p < 0.05 for the overall Slope parameter; no otherwise
sig_seasonality,yes/no,significant seasonality: yes if p < 0.05 for the seasonal term in the GAM; no otherwise
sig_autocorr,yes/no,significant autocorrelation: yes if model_refit = TRUE (ar1_start exceeded the threshold); no otherwise
