# Initial Explorations    

This directory contains scripts that were written to visualize and explore the data before final download and processing occurred. Data organization has changed and these scripts have been moved, so data paths will need to be updated if the scripts are to be re-run.  

Subfolders are:  

-   `MDLs` - explorations of nutrient data that may be below detection.  
-   `model_packages` - explorations of different R packages that can be used to calculate trends on SWMP data - how each of them works, and how results compare between them.  
-   `other` - assorted scripts for individuals' exploration that don't fall under other needed categories.  
-   `QAQC_flags` - explorations of data by QA/QC flag status, based on definitions of which flags and codes will lead to data being kept or discarded for this project.  
-    `seasonality` - explorations of different ways to handle seasonal data.
